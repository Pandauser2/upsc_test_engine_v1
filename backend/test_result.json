The explanation correctly identifies that the relationship between economy and development is presented as interconnected and mutually important rather than hierarchical. Option C appropriately captures this unified, interdependent relationship where both elements are treated as equally crucial and connected. The other options either suggest a hierarchical relationship (A, D) or complete dependency (B), which would not align with the interconnected presentation described in the explanation."},{"question":"How are environment and ecology positioned in terms of their significance?","options":{"A":"Environment and ecology are secondary considerations","B":"Environment and ecology are important and warrant serious attention","C":"Environment and ecology are relevant only for rural areas","D":"Environment and ecology are purely scientific concepts"},"correct_option":"B","explanation":"The text explicitly states that 'Environment and ecology are important,' indicating that these areas are considered significant and deserving of serious attention rather than being secondary or limited in scope.","difficulty":"easy","topic_id":"50a67fb6-0a71-4d99-a525-4e6e92e8b1e4","id":"431be299-ad89-4266-8c59-acc21c2a5e30","generated_test_id":"715e9066-6bd2-4d72-aa93-06b660127e9c","sort_order":2,"validation_result":"The answer and explanation are correct. Option B accurately reflects that environment and ecology are positioned as important areas that warrant serious attention. The explanation properly references the text's explicit statement about their importance and correctly distinguishes this from the other options that would diminish their significance (secondary considerations, limited scope to rural areas only, or purely academic concepts). The reasoning is sound and consistent with the content."},{"question":"How is geography conceptualized in terms of its scope of study?","options":{"A":"Geography focuses exclusively on natural phenomena","B":"Geography encompasses both physical landforms and human settlement patterns","C":"Geography is limited to cartographic representations","D":"Geography prioritizes human aspects over physical features"},"correct_option":"B","explanation":"The text specifies that 'Geography covers physical and human aspects,' indicating a comprehensive approach that includes both natural/physical features and human-related geographical elements.","difficulty":"easy","topic_id":"e8d6ebae-9a95-4f0a-94ee-106ef6cf482d","id":"89ee292a-6e5d-4b60-84ea-902c5ddcfd65","generated_test_id":"715e9066-6bd2-4d72-aa93-06b660127e9c","sort_order":3,"validation_result":"The correct key (B) is accurate. The explanation is consistent and correct - geography is indeed conceptualized as a discipline that encompasses both physical aspects (landforms, climate, natural features) and human aspects (settlement patterns, cultural landscapes, human-environment interactions). Option B correctly captures this dual scope, while the other options are too narrow or incorrect in their characterization of geography's comprehensive nature."}]}
